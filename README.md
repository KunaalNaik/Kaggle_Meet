# Kaggle Meet Objective

The Youtube videos and other sources generally don’t show the reality of complex data and challenges and performance measure ( Leaderboard ) and cause of that very reason Kaggle shines bright.
We are fellow Kagglers and want to progress as fast as we can but the case is that we all are new and don’t know much on how to collaborate and compete and this group is to solve that.

Now what will our manner of proceding / Objectives :-

## 1/ Get in the notebooks master category
	
The reason is that till you reach master in notebooks you get a idea of what could be 	possible and how to procede further in a problem. Also a general idea about NLP.

Also your work is generally not presented in front of Other Masters/GrandMasters unless
you are a Master, and hence our work will get better reach after that.

## Closed Competitions
	
Why closed – Cause of Literature, as we all are new we need more guidance and closed 	competitions have plenty of it and then don’t use State-of-art models, no need for image 	processing stuffs, No Super large datasets. BUT YEAH THE LEADERBOARD is there.
	
We will get in Top 10% in 5 different competitions and after that we will move to the Live
Live Competitions.

## How to Participate in Competitions -

We will form teams of five or so among ourselves and study the competition by ourselves
for a certain period of time say a 20 Days and after that compare the Scores among ourselves
and after deciding the winner group we will share insights to cometition by all the groups.
And give a final submission within 5 Days. To motivate the winning team, they will decide
next competition and that should also be approved by more than 50% of group members to 	finalize.
